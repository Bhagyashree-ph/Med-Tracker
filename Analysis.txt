Title : Medication-Management-Tool

1. Business Scenario
Managing different medications can be pretty cumbersome for a patient, especially if they are
taking medication for different ailments.
First, there’s the issue of keeping the schedule of every medication in mind. Then, they have to
manage the quantity of every medication and get more before one of them runs out. Missing on
dosage can be very harmful to a patient’s well-being.

2. Business Process Requriments
We need to create a digital solution for helping people with medication management. They would
have to enter their different medication and its schedule once into the application. Then the
application will alert them about their dosage time and track how many doses they have taken to
remind them about buying more medicine.
A personal management tool that allows users to input prescription details, and send
reminders for when they need to be taken or refilled. This tool is ideal for users with multiple
different prescriptions to keep track of and aims to help reduce the likelihood of missing
doses.

Tasks
1. Develop a system for tracking prescriptions and dosages.
2. Include features for alerts and reminders for both patients and providers.
3. Integrate with pharmacy systems for real-time updates
4. Input prescription details, including medication name, dosage, and
instructions.
5. Set customizable medication reminder notifications.
6. Receive notifications for upcoming medication doses.
7. Get alerted when it's time to refill your prescriptions.
8. Store important information about your healthcare providers and pharmacies.
